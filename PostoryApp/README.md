# Postory
*Life Stories around the World*

*-T9Hacks 2023-*
***Winner - Organizer's Choice***

## Overview
Postory encourages individuals to share important moments in their life and where they happened. The platform allows users to anonymously post their stories at any location in the world, as well as view other stories that have been already posted. In addition, users are able to filter stories based on tags that define what type of story they are sharing.

## Inspiration
We were inspired by Queering the Map as it brought together people who could share their queer experiences and finding comfort in other's stories! We wanted to create a platform that could connect the community through many ways, from personal accomplishments, to finding true love!

## Tech Stack
Postory was developed using React with Material UI, as well as Firebase and Firestore for storing data real-time. We used Google Maps API to provide the interactable map. Assets were created using Adobe Illustrator and Procreate.

## Challenges
This was our first time working with the Google Maps API and it took awhile for us to become familiar with. Another challenge we faced was querying our Firebase data, as we accidentally exceeded the quota in just a few hours and had to recreate the database to use.

## Accomplishments
We are proud that we were able to get the API working smoothly, as well as add in quality of life features, such as adding the markers and filtering the existing stories by the tags. We're also proud of our design and theming in which we created the assets. Given more time, we would have developed more of the postal/postcard aesthetic.

## What We Learned
We learned more about React and gained more familiarity with connecting front-end to backend services, as well as working with APIs.

## What's Next for Postory
We hope to polish the theme and design and add features such as animations, as well as capabilities such as filtering spam messages and better UI overall.
